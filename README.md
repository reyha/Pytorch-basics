# Pytorch-basics

This repo implements Jeremy Howard's (founder of fast.ai) tutorial on PyTorch's neural network module (torch.nn).

It is divided in two parts:

Part 1. shows how to create a custom NN classifier without using torch.nn 

Part 2. elaborately discusses as to how to create a NN classifier using torch.nn
